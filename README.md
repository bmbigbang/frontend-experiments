This React/Next JS app displays a list of video contributions from the backend server.

It allows users to filter contributions by owner, title and description by selecting the type of filter and text and
clicking the Apply button. At the same time a from/to date can be selected, allowing the user to narrow down the start 
and end date of the contributions.

To run the project, follow these steps:

```
npm install
npm run build
npm run start
```

The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

Alternatively, run the development build using:

```
npm run dev
```
